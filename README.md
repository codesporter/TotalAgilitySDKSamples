# KTA OPMT SDK Helper Web Services - ONLY KTA 7.5 or above!

TotalAgility OPMT SDK Helper connected through Web Services

TotalAgility OPMT and TotalAgility Azure do not support using the TotalAgility SDK API from custom .NET assemblies executed through .NET activities or .NET form actions because the custom .NET assemblies run in a non-trusted sandbox in TotalAgility OPMT and TotalAgility Azure.

You can directly call the TotalAgility SDK API from the .NET activities or .NET actions in TotalAgility OPMT and TotalAgility Azure.

Furthermore, you can also call the TotalAgility SDK API from custom .NET activities if connected via Web Services. 
The propose of this Project is to share examples of how this be achieved.
